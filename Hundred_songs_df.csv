She's living in a world and it's on fire
Filled with catastrophe but she knows she can fly away

And she's burning it down
Ooh-oh, she got her head in the clouds

This girl is on fire
She's walking on fire
This girl is on fire

Looks like a girl but she's a flame
So bright, she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try but you'll never forget her name
She's on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say

Ooh-oh, we got our feet on the ground

'Cause they can see the flame that's in her eyes
Watch her as she's lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she's a lonely girl
And it's a lonely world
But she gon' let it burn, baby, burn, baby

Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

Be loving you 'til we're 70

And, baby, my heart
Could still fall as hard at 23

And I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So, honey, now
Take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mhm
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause, honey, your soul
Could never grow old, it's evergreen

And, baby, your smile's
Forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

That, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms

Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are, oh-oh

So, baby, now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars

Lay down, way down

See baby girl, I know, I know it's you
You, you know you want my body
Right, right next to you
No one else can hold you, touch your body like I do
Skin so soft, caress it as I kiss all over you
Baby, if you like, maybe you can spend a night

Hold on (the way you whine pon the bed)

Don't be shy to me, take control of me
So hold on (buckle up)
Hold on my dear (we going for a ride)
It's been so long (she said)
Since I had feelings, I'm feeling for you

'Cause all I do is hola then I adiós
Hit the Caribbean store for some curry goat
She said my meat taste good so she sucked the bone

I'm with a white girl, dancing with some stamina
She a wine to bashment while I'm grabbing her
She movin' like she got some black in her
That was before I put my black in her

I'm living so single and free
I sit comfy, knowing no-one's cheating on me

Got something to say
Craig David
7 days
Check it out, yeah

On my way to see my friends
Who lived a couple blocks away from me (oh)
As I walked through the subway
It must have been about quarter past three
In front of me
Stood a beautiful honey with a beautiful body
She asked me for the time
I said it'd cost her a name
A six-digit number and a date with me tomorrow at nine

Did she decline? No
Didn't she mind? I don't think so
Was it for real? Damn sure
What was the deal? A pretty girl, age 24
So was she keen? She couldn't wait
Cinnamon queen? Let me update
What did she say?
She said she'd love to rendezvous
She asked me what we were gonna do
Said we'd start with a bottle of Moët for two

Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday
We chilled on Sunday

I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday
We chilled on Sunday

Nine was the time
'Cause I'll be getting mine
And she was looking fine
Smooth talker
She told me
She'd love to unfold me all night long
Ooh, I loved the way she kicked it
From the front to back she flipped
(Back she flipped it, ooh, the way she kicked it)

And I, oh-oh, I yeah
Hope that she'd care
'Cause I'm a man who'll always be there
(Ooh, yeah)

I'm not a man to play around baby
(Ooh, yeah)
'Cause a one-night stand isn't really fair
From the first impression girl
Hmm, you don't seem to be like that
'Cause there's no need to chat, for there'll be plenty for that

From the subway to my home
Endless ringing of my phone
When you're feeling all alone
All you gotta do
Is just call me, call me

Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday
We chilled on Sunday

I met this girl on Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday
We were making love by Wednesday
And on Thursday and Friday and Saturday
We chilled on Sunday

(Break it down, break it down)
Since I met this special lady
Ooh, yeah
I can't get her of my mind
She's one of a kind
And I ain't about to deny it
It's a special kind of thing
With you, oh

Monday
Took her for a drink on Tuesday

Soakin' up the views, but you choose to blow it up""

I ain't Blood or Crip, I'm Harlem

Do it like my bro madman, slaughter
See GT re a box, lovely
Back then he used to re up, quarter
Bro let it sing with a Smith, Jorja
'016 they crash whips, Corsa
You was in school doing maths
When I was in T with the cats, caller
Ski do a drill then dance
If the barbies ask say you're way too inner
Rich off rap 'fore I learnt how to whip
Bellz at the pot just watching it simmer
Amiri jeans with the leopard print
And I got ones with stripes like Tigger
Fuck what my bro done, that's my jigga
Send a trophy, she a gorgeous winner
Big Ski look like Risky with my mask on
So they get confused
Dem man chatting about us man
Don't mix me to your hoes or boos
Shotty just dropped to the knees
If it never got chopped would've dropped to the shoes

Not in a bookie, want it on news

Nuff of them yutes been bun like hotdog
I'm in new CD not Dunlop

Know seh my mileage high
Bro let that fly, don't know how much times
Bob, Gibson they slide
Fired up, live (Live)
Anyone riding with chingers, you're not on my level
Stay on your side

Someone's gutted, they hate surprise (Muh, muh)

My favorite girl had the French braids
I had a crush on her since back-a-day
She said her 'usna needs a bandage
After I come 'round and gave her the 12-gauge
You tried call my phone, but it was engaged
I was with my lil' mama, she was honey glazed
I've been crushin' on her since back then
Just the other day I gave her the MAC-10
I don't want just any girl, 'cause I'm a little choosy
But I swear I'm a sucker for a lil' cutie
I had a skin fade like Lil Boosie
And then I went and give lil' mama the lil' uzi
'Cause you got a body shape that I can't forget
The way I make you drip when I'm talkin' slick
I'm ashamed 'cause when I came, I was bustin' quick

Only God can judge me, but my friend's a lifer
My life is too fast, so I can never wife her
I'm from the East Coast but she's a Westsider
I scoped her from far 'cause I'm the best sniper
Said she had the melons, so I go and get 'em
Spray with my AK-47
The way she keeps me guessin', she is a blessin'
But she only loves me for my 357
I think she was Bajan or maybe Trini
Every time I linked her, I had a nine mili'
I had to link a cougar with a Luger
But the next time, I bring out the big bazooka
It's the return of the mack, call it the sequel
I'm known as the Mack like Beanie Sigel
Before she got undressed, she was already see-through
Then she fell in love with my Desert Eagle

I know you're in love

'Cause he don't deserve it
And when you see him in the club
Just flip your hair, don't show him any love
'Cause you've had enough
Woah, oh, oh

'Cause he was just a d- and I knew it (hey)
Got me going mad sitting in this chair (oh)
Like I don't care
Gotta get him out my hair
I tried everything but it's useless
He pushed me so far now I'm on the edge
Make him disappear

Here in this dimension
You and I are meant to be

Now that you're here
I can remind you
Of the things you've been dreamin'
Times two
I promise you
If you just give me 24
Man, all I need is 24 hours
I promise you'll want plenty more
You'll probably be with it forever

There's no better time than now

There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now

And when you climb on top that's the ultimate road trip
Ride on me like your Pac got me thinkin' it's 96'
I can rap on some nineties shit, wrap your leggings around my hip
I'm so hip to it tourists want to come speculate
But if I stay monogamous promise this kiss will always taste like candy
And yeah, it's obvious mama now probably can't stand me
I'm sure they're tired of this look that you have when you're antsy
We gon' fuck around (mm) we gon' fuck around
And triple through triplets of babies right now
And that might break the record and no, that don't mean you're fertile
That means we're fucking reckless, plus we don't use protection
I find myself reading old text messages when I'm bored
We find ourselves sexting 'til that connection is restored
I know that sounds immature, but if we never grow up
Then I'm wishing good luck on the seas that's inside this wall

Come to me
Come, come to me
Look at what you've done to me
You put a gun to me
Then you brought the sun to me

Shine like blood diamonds
Learning to have patience
Only 'cause you are timeless
The universe energy doesn't lie
And this chemistry is infinity at a million
Times
I wrote a million rhymes to scrabble your
Star power
And after 24 bars, you get 24 hours

There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
You gotta stay ready, yeah
There's no place quite like here
There's no better time than now
That's why I stay ready

Nothing's for sure but, right now
Gotta get yours like, right now

But I be on my shit man

Is what you're given

Then baby, it will never grow

It's just the time's wrong
Yeah, I know what you did
But, baby, I'm grown
And my love is patient
And kind, and shit
This is real we can build
Through different types of shit
If you was really the realest
Wouldn't be fightin' it
I think your pride is just

In the way
Funny how everything changed
Once you got all that you wanted
Nothing was ever the same

And though I don't need you, I don't need you 
I don't need you, I don't need you
I still want you (oh)
I don't mean to, I don't mean to 
I don't mean to, I don't mean to
But I, but I love you

I been knowing you for long enough
Damn, I need you right now
You can take your time, don't have to rush
This might take us a while (yeah)

When you get here don't just say a word, got no time to play

I know you think that you know me
But you ain't even seen my dark side
It's as if it's you only
So baby, do it right, do me right

We can go over time
We can move fast, then rewind
When you put your body on mine
And collide, collide
It could be one of those nights
When we don't turn off the lights
Wanna see your body on mine
And collide, collide

Baby, it's all yours if you want it, all yours if you want it
Put it down you can want it, tonight
Said it's all yours if you want it, all yours if you want it
Put it down you can want it, let's collide

Wakin' up, she on it
Good love in the mornin'
Get on top my cojones
I pleasure you for the moment
This don't come with no warranty
You want it but can't afford it
My world is different than yours

You're opinion of me is glory
Glorifying in all these foreign
Back to future, and DeLorean
You ain't used to feelin' this important
Cars imported, girls imported
Insubordinate, get deported
Baby, check my inventory
Got a whole lot in store for ya

Birkin bags, purple tags
I can put a whole lot of shit on blast
Vera Wang, Balenciaga
Baby, you ain't never too fly for that
I talk a lot of shit (shit), 'cause I can back it up (back it up)
She know I'm the shit (shit), so baby back it up

Put it down you can want it tonight
Said it's all yours you can want it, all yours can you want it
Put it down you can want it, let's collide

I know that this is love when we touch, boy
You got my heart
And can't nobody make me feel like you do, boy, like you do

But when I call, you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside

To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well

Are running out of time

Okay, I don't wear no makeup, no purse in my hands
My resting bitch face is mistaken for the mean girl
But what if I told you
There's nothing I want more in this world

Than somebody who loves me naked
Someone who never asks for love
But knows how to take it
Are you that somebody
Who sees a wall and breaks it?
Are you ready to fight just to see what's lost behind my flaws?
Can you love me naked?

I could be pissed, but I'll act like I'm not
I really remember when I say I forgot
No matter how hard I try
To run away from love at the end of the night

I need someone who loves me when I wake up
Who thinks I'm beautiful when I'm looking fucked up
I want the perfect love, am I asking too much?
Someone who shoots for the stars, know when
I think I'm not even good enough

I need somebody who loves me naked (who loves me naked)

I'll go nuts for you, go cuckoo, lose my cool and all
And I know that shit was wrong, I shouldn't've did what I did
Just wipe your eyes and stop this cryin'
I told the truth, that I'd been lyin'
I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, I'm sorry for what I did to you
Take me back, if I was you and I did what I did
I probably would, I probably wouldn't
Take you back, if I was you and I did what I did

I gave you racks, I tried to buy in
I even did the unthinkable, and I'm sorry for what I did to you

We started off as close friends (close friends)
Somehow you turned into my girlfriend (my girlfriend)
We used to tell each other everything (everything)
I even went and bought her diamond rings, matching earrings
Everything was so cool (so cool)
Lately baby been actin' so rude (been so rude)
I don't know what somebody told you (what they told you)
But I ain't gon' lie, I miss the old you

Keep our business to ourselves
The internet ain't doin' no help
I know I shouldn't've never left
But everything I did for us
And us, I'm speakin' on my kids
Thinkin' 'bout this shit I did
Like how the hell I get myself involved in this bullshit?
Married to the game, I can't make you my fiancé
Bad young boss bitch, treat her like Beyoncé
But damn what them broads say, I fucked them all the first day
And that's why you trippin' anyway, like when I fuck them I don't pay
Even if we never speak again
I'll make sure you're ridin' in the latest Benz
Keep your business all apart if you can stay out of mine
Bought a brand new Audemars but I done ran out of time

I don't take L's or lose

I've been out here with the goons (Bang, pow, boom)

Got one ting, man, she came from the south
And she wanna hold my spear like Britney
Got one ting, man, she came from east
And she wanna sing for me like Whitney
And she wanna have my pickney
Don't be silly, don't be silly

My bros in the lab like Dexter
And she wanna take this BBC and I ain't talkin' 'bout 1Xtra
Defend my bros like Evra
All my haters hating, I just tell 'em, ""Back to sender""
I might bell her in then put her right back like Hector
The world so fucked nowadays
All they do is follow, unfollow (facts)
I don't care 'bout the latest trends
'Cause I might even die tomorrow (mmhmm)
That's why I ain't sleepy like hollow
If I ever win the lotto
I'll share that with my family
And make sure they don't borrow

In California with my toes in the sand

Touch my neck and I'll touch yours

Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no

Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides a mind
To move to a place so far away
The goosebumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love the taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside, it starts to pour

Comin' down

One love, one house

Ayy
Is what it is, but nothing's the same
Side ting tryna upgrade to the mains
Toxic love, can you please stay away?
Only involved if the love both ways
Only involved if the love don't change
Look to my bro and said, ""Please don't change""
How many man out your group gon' back this?
How many man out your group gon' stay? (Bullet)

She told me that she keeps on flirtin'
I told her she look better in person (hahaa)
Stress on my head to attain high earnings
And the convos, let's keep it to business
Welcome to the Brum Town district (lemme land)
A land for the drugs and paigons
If you get locked, then your friends won't visit

Yo, I might go MIA for doing up real life GTA
Yo, feds tryna put me in the pen, but they can't get me in no way, no way
Yo, tell a boy indicate, try switch up quick, don't get in my lane
Yo, tell a girl she's the same (just another)
Just here for the fame
Yo, you know say I'm rappin' like Sterling, ayy
'Cause sometimes I feel like I'm ballin', yeah
When I look at my earnings, uh, uh, uh (yo)
Bad B keep twistin' and turnin'
Bad Bs gon' listen and learn it
And niggas are all the same
I know it won't change 'cause the girls are a burden

Tryna run man up in the worst way
The side ting tryna talk about Birkin, about Birkin, it ain't even your birthday (shit)
And now she really wan' play games
But, darling, I like playing 'em too
Bruck off your back in the bedsheet pattern, like I do things that a man can't do
Think it's a joke? Nah, I ain't jokin'

(Lemme land, lemme land)
Move your waist to my rasclart motion
Hold me down if you feel like foldin'
Grip your neck, should I squeeze or choke it?
From the ends where the gang reload it
I might just ghost it and say that I'm loading (yeah)
And she knows I'm a little bit toxic
Tryna hold man like, who are you holding?

Yo, the opps them DOA
Bad B slapped it, don't know her name
She, she bopped you with a iPhone 8
Still tapped it, uh, like some Apple Pay
Peter Pan when I fly away
Multiple girls, that's my five a day
Dead tings can't even get the time of day
'Cause I ain't even got that much time on my day

With a bad B tryna isolate
So you know say I have to put some ice on the cake
They call me CK all day, all day
But I'm only really tryna see the opps them K
Man will mash work on the field like Foden
Mask on my face and it not 'cause of COVID
Infiltrate the gateway with a trojan
'Cause I know the opps love let hoes in

I know a love song, yeah?

Really want to give you all
But flex in front of your friends
How that work?
Swear that you doing the most
But we take a picture, can't post it
How that work?
When you talking
Back that shit up
Won't you say my, say my

So won't you say my name say my name
If you claim you want me
It ain't no thang
You acting kinda shady
You ain't been calling me baby, oh
Boy, you can go and stop playing games
Playing games

Games (games)
Games (oh games)

I feel like I'm double-tappin' 2K17
The difference is this machine got a long-arse magazine
I know you see this hunting knife 
That's pokin' through my jeans (yeah, yeah, yeah)

If you tell me one man, just one man that you shot
Then I'll never rap again
I don't wanna hear that cap again
Roll up, lift the pole up and slap at them (rollin')
No bells for the nina, bring the dagger then
Yo, I don't know who them boy think they're badder than (what?)
Get me mad again (what?), Get me mad again
So I can ching man's chest and back again (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Too real for the scene, they ain't seen what I seen
Whistle on a pistol with a beam (boom boom)
Crib Session, I had the machine
Daily Duppy, I went with a full magazine
Four-fizzy on FRE
The four-five if man don't free up the cream (yo, gimme that)
We slimed out-, then -
They're callin' us Robbery Team
Please stop bothering me
Did I hit that stain? Well, obviously
Jokes, I ain't do none of that, B
Cah these niggas snitchin' anonymously
Drill, I'm runnin' it prominently
Man bully these rappers, that's dominancy (yeah)

Fucked up, tell them boy stop copyin' me

I ain't thinkin' 'bout no Covid virus
Mask on BHA, press on the nine
It's fuck killin' them with kindness
Those-, but now one of them's minus
Fire still walks and I'm blocking sliders (bro)
They keep saying we're wet
Come test the waters and find it out (yeah)
He didn't mind his mouth
So the guys got mad and they slimed him out
Whoever's the king better hide that crown
If I swing my ching I'ma knife that down
Tell my- get stuck and I lie that down
If he still talks crud, I'ma slide back 'round
Gamble your life, blud, bet it (bet it)
Roll the dice and see if man tek it (tek it)
Load the nine with bine and selec' it
Aim the wap at his wig and press it, press it
Stepped in the room, clocked two scroom
I instantly backed my dick out (woo)
I pray that she ain't got a big mouth
Yo, gyal, both of you two take your tits out (take your tits out)

It don't make no sense why- tried to hop the fence (nah)
Don't like us 'cause we borred up all his friends

But when my license finish, I'ma circle 'round them, circle 'round them
