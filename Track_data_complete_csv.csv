And it's stickin' out, yeah, like a sore thumb (bleh)
With a forehead that it grew horns from (look)
Still a white jerk (it's him), pullin' up in a Chrysler to the cypher
With the Vics, Percs and a Bud Light shirt
Lyrical technician (yeah), an electrician (yeah)
Y'all light work
And I don't gotta play pretend, it's you I make believe (what?)
And you know I'm here to stay 'cause me (why?)
If I was to ever take a leave (what?)
It would be aspirin to break a feve' (yeah)
If I was to ask for Megan Thee (what?)

Would I really have a shot at a feat?

Now back in the days of old me (when?)
Right around the time I became a dope fiend (oh)
Ate some codeine as a way of coping (mm)
Taste of opiates, case of O.E.
Turned me into smiley face emoji (woo)
My shit may not be age-appropriate
But I will hit an eight-year-old in the face with a participation trophy
Plus I have zero doubts
That this whole world's 'bout
To turn into some girl scouts
That censorship bureau's out to (shut me down)
So when I started this verse
It did start off lighthearted at first (hmm)
But it feels like I'm targeted
Mind-bogglin' how my profit has skyrocketed
Look what I pocketed
Yeah, the shit is just like y'all had been light joggin', and
I've been runnin' at full speed
And that's why I'm ahead like my noggin', and
I'm the fight y'all get in
When you debate who the best, but opps, I'm white chalkin' when
I step up to that mic, cock it then

Sometimes I wonder what the old me'd say (if what?)
If he could see the way shit is today (look at this shit, man)
He'd probably say that everything is gay (like happy)
What's my name? What's my name? (Slim Shady)

So how many little kids still wanna act like me?
I'm a bigger prick than cacti be (yeah)
And that's why these (what?)
Words sting just like you were being attacked by bees (bzz)
In the coupe, leaning back my seat (what?)
Bumpin' R. Kelly's favorite group (uh), the black guy (guy) pees (haha, pees)
In my Air Max 90s
White Ts, walkin' parental advisory
My transgender cat's Siamese (why?)
Identifies as Black, but acts Chinese
Like a motherfuckin' Hacky Sack, I treat (what?)
The whole world 'cause I got it at my feet (yeah)
How can I explain to you (what?)
That even myself I'm a danger to? (Yeah)
I hop on tracks like a kangaroo
And say a few things or two to anger you
But fuck that, if I think that shit, I'ma say that shit
Cancel me, what? Okay, that's it
Go ahead, Paul, quit, snake-ass prick
You male cross-dresser, fake-ass bitch
And I'll probably get shit for that (watch)
But you can all suck my dick, in fact
Fuck them, fuck Dre, fuck Jimmy, fuck me, fuck you
Fuck my own kids, they're brats (fuck 'em)
They can screw off (yeah), them and you all (uh)
You too, Paul (punk), got two balls
Big as RuPaul's (whoa)
What you thought you saw ain't what you saw (nah)
'Cause you're never gon' see me
Caught sleepin' and see the kidnappin' never did happen (no)

Vi que tu mirada ya estaba llamándome
Muéstrame el camino que yo voy

Oh, tú, tú eres el imán y yo soy el metal
Me voy acercando y voy armando el plan
Solo con pensarlo se acelera el pulso (oh yeah)

Ya, ya me estás gustando más de lo normal
Todos mis sentidos van pidiendo más
Esto hay que tomarlo sin ningún apuro

Despacito
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito
Deja que te diga cosas al oído
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
Despacito
Quiero desnudarte a besos despacito
Firmar las paredes de tu laberinto
Y hacer de tu cuerpo todo un manuscrito (sube, sube, sube)
(Sube, sube) Oh

Quiero ver bailar tu pelo
Quiero ser tu ritmo (uh oh, uh oh)
Que le enseñes a mi boca (uh oh, uh oh)
Tus lugares favoritos (favoritos, favoritos baby)
Déjame sobrepasar tus zonas de peligro (uh oh, uh oh)
Hasta provocar tus gritos (uh oh, uh oh)
Y que olvides tu apellido (dirididi Daddy)

(DY) Si te pido un beso ven dámelo (eh)
Yo sé que estás pensándolo (eh)
Llevo tiempo intentándolo (eh)
Mami, esto es dando y dándolo
Sabes que tu corazón conmigo te hace bam bam
Sabe que esa beba 'tá buscando de mi bam bam
Ven prueba de mi boca para ver cómo te sabe
Quiero, quiero, quiero ver cuánto amor a ti te cabe
Yo no tengo prisa, yo me quiero dar el viaje
Empezamo' lento, después salvaje

Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando poquito a poquito
Cuando tú me besas con esa destreza
Veo que eres malicia con delicadeza
Pasito a pasito, suave suavecito
Nos vamos pegando, poquito a poquito (oh oh)
Y es que esa belleza es un rompecabezas (oh no)
Pero pa' montarlo aquí tengo la pieza (slow, oh yeah)

Despacito
Vamo' a hacerlo en una playa en Puerto Rico
Hasta que las olas griten ""Ay, bendito""
Para que mi sello se quede contigo (báilalo)

That would always think the sky is fallin'
Why am I so differently wired? Am I a martian?
What kind of twisted experiment am I involved in?
'Cause I don't belong in this world
That's why I'm scoffin' at authority, defiant often
Flyin' off at the handle at my mom
No dad, so I am noncompliant at home

At school, I'm just shy and awkward
And I don't need no goddamn psychologist
Tryna diagnose why I have all these underlyin' problems
Thinkin' he can try and solve 'em
I'm outside chalkin' up drawings
On the sidewalk and in the front drive talkin'
To myself, either that or inside hidin' off in

The corner somewhere quiet, tryin' not to
Be noticed 'cause I'm cryin' and sobbin'
I had a bad day at school, so I ain't talkin'
Some cocksucker shoved me into a fuckin' locker
'Cause he said that I eye-balled him

And if you fall, I'll get you there
I'll be your savior from (yeah) all the wars

Why am I so differently wired in my noggin?
'Cause sporadic as my thoughts come, it's mind-bogglin'
'Cause I obsess on everything in my mind, small shit
Bothers me, but not my father, he said sayonara
Then split, but I don't give a shit
I'm fine long as there's batteries in my Walkman
Nothing is the matter with me
Shit, look on the bright side, at least I ain't walkin'

I bike ride through the neighborhood of my apartment
Complex on a ten-speed which I've acquired parts that
I find in the garbage, a frame then put tires on it
Headphones on, look straight ahead if kids try and start shit
But if this is all there is for me life offers
Why bother even tryin' to put up a fight? It's nonsense
But I think a light bulb just lit up in my conscience
What about them rhymes I've been jottin'?

They are kind of giving me confidence
Instead of tryin' to escape through my comics
Why don't I just blast a little something like Onyx?
To put me in the mood to wanna fight and write songs that
Say what I wanna say to the kid that said that I eye-balled him
Grab hold of my balls, like, ""That's right, fight's on, bitch!""
Who woulda knew, from the moment I turned the mic on, that
I could be iconic in my conquest?
That's word to Phife Dawg from A Tribe Called Quest

It's not up to me, we can only see
This is my legacy, legacy, legacy, legacy

I used to be the type of kid that would always think the sky's fallin'
Now I think the fact that I'm differently wired's awesome
'Cause if I wasn't, I wouldn't be able to work words like this
And connect lines like crosswords
And use my enemy's words as strength
To try and draw from, and get inspired off 'em
'Cause all my life I was told and taught I am not shit
By you wack fuckin' giant sacks of lyin' dog shit

Now you shut up, bitch, I am talkin'
Thought I was full of horseshit
And now you fuckin' worship the ground on which I am walkin'
Me against the world, so what? I'm Brian Dawkins
Versus the whole 0-16 Lions offense
So bring on the Giants, Falcons, and Miami Dolphins
It's the body bag game, bitch, I'm supplyin' coffins
'Cause you dicks butt kiss, bunch of Brian Baldingers
You're gon' die a ball-licker, I've been diabolical

With this dialogue since '99 Rawkus
You don't respect the legacy I leave behind, y'all can
Suck a dick; the day you beat me, pigs'll fly out my ass
In a flyin' saucer full of Italian sausage
The most high exaltin' and I ain't haltin'
'Til I die of exhaustion, inhale my exhaust fumes
The best part about me is I am not you
I'm me, and I'm the Fire Marshall, and this is my-

I'll guide you home no matter where you are""

One day my father, he told me
""Son, don't let it slip away""
When I was just a kid I heard him say
""When you get older
Your wild heart will live for younger days
Think of me if ever you're afraid""

He said, ""One day, you'll leave this world behind
So live a life you will remember""
My father told me when I was just a child
These are the nights that never die
My father told me

My technique is so sick, I'm 'bout to make the hit quick
Whole 'lotta muscle, you don't wanna be in a tussle (yeah, yeah)

Ali I'm payin' the homage, policy is to be honest
I take it beyond it though
I can relate to ebonics, and really I hate to be ominous
All of your hate is too obvious

I am a gangster with knowledge
If you wanna enter the ring, I would hate to be opposite

It'll be chaos like an emerald chase
When I face off in a Nicolas Cage

Y-y-y-yeah, I'm livin' in rage
Punch a pussy nigga like I'm fistin' his babe
I was sittin' in the 'spital, goin' mental, doc had told me
They'll forget me, but they didn't, I remember them days
And I don't wanna be Batman, nigga, I'm Bane
Literally how the venom enters my veins
Since a little one, Killa really been sick in the brain
And the more I think about it, my life was twisted, wait

Reminiscin' on when mom and dad would wonder
Why they couldn't reach me like they didn't have my number
Fightin' for my sanity, I never had the hunger
Put a nigga underground quick, that's a bunker
Sh-shock 'em like I'm Master's brother
Better pick your battles, busters halfway under
Hit more times than acupuncture
When it comes to rumblin', I'm Afro Thunder

Really it be funny when I kick it to you dummies
How I'm grippin' on the iron when I'm rhymin' on the mic
Because it really will get bloody like I'm kickin' it with buddies
When I beat a nigga up like I was Iron nigga Mike

I tell 'em they don't wanna tussle when I'm at 'em, they gon' drop
Bet you that he stumble when I jab him then I cross
Leave a nigga humble like, ""Damn"" when Kenny dropped

We stay hungry, we devour
Put in the work, put in the hours
And take what's ours (ahoo)
Black and Samoan in my veins
My culture bangin' with Strange
I change the game, so what's my motherfuckin' name? (Rock!)

(What they gonna get though?)
Desecration, defamation
If you wanna bring it to the masses
Face to face now we escalatin' when I have to put boots to asses
Mean on ya like a dream when I'm rumblin'
You're gonna scream, ""Mama""
So bring drama to the king Brahma (then what?)
Comin' at ya with extreme mana

Another night starin' straight into the void and

To see there's so much more to life
Than fortune and fame, validation and pain
When you always want more
There's nothing to gain
